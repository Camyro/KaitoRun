# KaitoRun ðŸš˜
The game **Kaito Run** is an educational game and will serve as a complement to **Elefante**. It is a 2D game where the protagonist is late for school and also has to deliver an extra credit assignment that will help him pass the school year.

## Objective
The goal of the game is to arrive at class on time. To do this, youâ€™ll need to jump over various obstacles to avoid losing the game. Among these obstacles are:
1. Bushes
2. Mud
3. Cracks
4. Rocks

While dodging obstacles, youâ€™ll also have to answer math questions to earn abilities that will help you in the game. If you answer a question incorrectly, youâ€™ll lose one heart â€” and you only have three in total.


## Skills
In the game, we have the following abilities:
1. **Yoru** â€“ Grants the player the ability to pass a random number of obstacles without losing the game. *(Status: Completed)*
2. **Flash** â€“ Allows the player to make time move twice as fast for a limited period. *(Status: Completed)*
3. **Isa** â€“ Gives the player a shield that lets them pass through obstacles without losing for a limited time. *(Status: In Progress)*
These abilities make the game more fun, dynamic, and easier to complete.
